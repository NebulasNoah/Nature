    <p>
        The purpose of this web page is to act as a place that those who are intrested in enviromental issues can go to Learn
        about various things related to the enviroment. From general information about the enviroment to steps that one can take to
        reduce there impact, I hope that you find whatever it is you are looking for.

    <h2>
        Starting with the basics:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes people try changing to much to quickly, its my opinion that offen times the best way to produce a large change is by starting small.
        Some ideas for some small things that you can try doing today are:
        <br><br>
        - Swapping some of the normal items that you have in your weekly shop for some vegan alternatives such as Tofu instead of chicken or veggie patties instead of beef patties.
        <br><br>
        - When you go shopping bring your own bag instead of paying for one at t he shops.
        <br><br>
        - Before putting on the heating, put some more layers on first.
        <br><br>
        - Use a metal water bottle instead of a plastic one.
        <br><br>
        - As you walk home, if you see a small peice of litter, pick it up and put it in the bin
        <br><br>
        - If something is old, instead of throwing it out, try finding an alternate use for it. Such as using old cloths as Pajamas
        <br><br>
        These are just some of the many examples of small things you can do. 
        The key thing is to try and see what works for you, finding what way to help lower your enviromental impact is the main goal
        and as long as you try even if you find one way doesn't work, thats ok you can just try a different way.

        Common Enviromental Questions?
    </h2>
  </div>
    <button class="collapsible">How can I reduce the amount of plastic i use?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br>
  <P>
  Plastic has become a very common thing that we all use, It does have it's uses, for example in food preservation. However in the past few decades
  plastic has started to become part of peoples lives more and more as they look for plastic solutions to problems that already have more sustainible
  options avalivble. One of the largest contributing factor is large oil companies putting aproximatlly Â£180bn into plastic products. With such a large
  amount of money being put into creating and marketing plastic items its no wonder there has been an increase in plastic products.
  <br><br>
   What the increase in plastic use has caused is lots of plastic waste to builds up and causes large amounts of damage to local wild life. Wild animals will often accidently
    consume the plastic or even get there heads stuck in open plastic bottles which unfortunatly offten leads to there early deaths. Its not just animals
    that get effected, recently it has been discovered that due to the animals we eat consuming plastic it means that we are also consuming an alarming
    amount of micro plastics. These micro plastics cause harm to our bodies and can increase our risk of various cancers.
  </P>
  <h3>
    Examples of uses of plastic and some more sustanible options to use instead:
  </h3>
  <p>
    <b>Plastic Water Bottles :</b> are probably one of the most common ones. They are avalible in every shop and are tippically used once then thrown away.
    A simple alternative is to use a metal water bottle instead, They are more expensive but if you use it over a long time it will become cheaper than
    had you used an equivilent amount of plastic bottles.
  </p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Is honey vegan?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  We offten hear talk about signing pettitions to "save the bees" but what are people talking about, Honey bee populations have only grown?
  Thats the problem, <b>HONEY</b> Bee populations have grown but other species of bee have either had the populations sevearly reduced or have even 
  gone extinct due to the increase in Honey bee populations. Because of the common confusion that all bees are the same it leads to people miss understanding
  the problem that we currently have. When they see headlines about all time highs for honey bee population they think it is a good thing, to an extent
  it is good that there is an insect population that is doing well. However problems arise when Honey bees are the only species of bee doing well. With
  the most obvious being the lowering of bio diversity in areas that Honey bees are farmed.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Whats the difference between a Honey Bee and any other kind of Bee?
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are roughly 274 species of wild bee, With 24 of them being extant bumble bees and 250
    of them being solidary bees. Solidary bees are bees that live on there own, they do not form 
    groups/hives. extant bumble bees are of the genius bombus and they do live form hives.
    <br><br>
    Compared to the large variaty of bumble bee species there is only one species of honey bee, <b>Apis Mellifera</b>,
    There are different sub species and some colour variation which will often have different common names.
    Although while they may have a different common name they are all still the same species.
    Dispite being only one species, the honey bee is not endangered and its population has only grown in recent years.
    <br><br>
    The key difference between bumble bees and honey bees is that bumble bees do not produce honey.
    The reason that they do not is because during the summer there queens will mate and then during
    the winter the queen hibernates while the rest of the hive dies, she will then wake up in the spring
    for this reason there is no point for them to make honey. Honey bees on the other hand do not do this and
    need to create enough food to survive over the winter and they do this by producing honey.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is so bad about honey bees?
  </h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned before, Honey bees reduce the biodiversity of where ever they are farmed. There are many reasons for this, Here are just a few of the
    main  reasons:
    <br><br>
    <b>Plant Optimisation : </b> What this means is that farmers have found out that certian flowers will produce more pollen that the bees
    can use to produce more honey. Because of this it is common for farmers to only grow one species of flower that is most optimised for there bees
    this leads to a drop in the plant diversity around where bees are commonly farmed.
    <br><br>
    <b>Competition : </b> Honey bee colonies have been found to collect between 10.5 and 46.75 kg of
    pollen annually, This means that any area with a honey bee colony will see a dramatic decrease in 
    the amount of pollen that is avalble to other species of bee and insect that use the pollen as a food source. 
    Many bumble bee species hae even been shown to change their behaviour and go for lower pollen count 
    plants to avoid direct competition with honey bees. It has been shown that in areas where honey Bee
    populations are controlled or lowered, wild bee populations are higher and more diverse.
    <br><br>
    <b>Disease Transmission : </b>Several diseases affecting honeybees can be found in bumblebees. 
    The seriousness to bumblebees of most of these diseases is not yet precisely known, but 
    bumblebees infected with Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) are known to develop deformed wings and
     suffer higher mortality. Bumblebees have also been found carrying the fungal pathogen 
     Nosema ceranae, a new disease of honeybees, and infectious diseases have been implicated 
     in bumblebee declines.
     <br> Disease transfer takes place mostly through the shedding of disease particles 
     onto shared flowers. DWV is the best-studied of these diseases, and the human-caused 
     movement of managed honeybees has been found to be the source of DWV outbreaks in 
     bumblebees. As many other diseases are likely to be spread in a similar fashion, it
      is reasonable to assume that having managed bees in close proximity to vulnerable 
      populations of wild bees will present a high risk of infecting these wild bees with 
      new diseases.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What can be done to reduce the negative impacts of honey bees?
  </h3>
  <p>
    <b>Plant Diversity : </b> One way to reduce the impact of honey bees on bio diversity is to
    inssure that even in areas where honey bees are farmed, farmers should plant a wide variaty of Plant
    species. This will help ensure a more diverse eco system which encourages the growth of
    various pollinator species.
    <br><br>
    <b>Hive Positioning : </b>It is vital that bee keepers avoid putting hives in enviroments where endangered
    species of wild bee live as the competition between the honey and wild bees will likely cause the 
    endangered species to either go extinct or sevearly reduce there numbers. As such it is important
    to servay the area and be awear of what polinators exist in an area before placing a bee hive and inssure
    that they are spaced in a way that it still allows room for wild bee populations.
    <br><br>
    <b>Buy Less or no honey : </b> The reason farmers are able to have more honey bees is because there is growing
    demand for more honey, if consumers ate less honey then it would mean farmers have less insentive to build more
    hives as profit margines would be lower.
    <br><br>
    <b>Look out for pettitions to sign : </b>There are various orginisations that will often put out pettitions
    for people to sign for things such as reducing the amount of harmful pestisides used to protecting an area with
    endangered bee species within them. Showing that you have an intrest in the well being of bees will help
    push more people and organisations in the direction of better bee preservation.
  </p>
  <h3>How is honey harvested?</h3>
  <p>
    There are many ways to harvest the honey from the hives, some more ethical than others. I will detail 
    one of the ethical ways that honey can be harvested, this method is usually used by small scale
    bee keepers and hobbiests.
    <br><br>
    During what most would consider a more ethical way of farming in order To harvest
     honey, beekeepers pull a frame from the hive and use a hot knife to cut away the wax. 
     Many keep the wax to make candles.
     <br><br>
     The next step in the process involves a honey extractor. 
     This is a device that takes the liquid honey out of a honeycomb 
     without destroying the frame. That way, the frame can be put back into 
     the hive and used again. Once the honey sits for a few days, itâs ready to
      bottle and eat.
    <br><br>
    When harvesting honey, itâs important to only take the 
    extra honeycombs the bees donât need. Thatâs especially true when 
    beekeepers harvest during fall. Bees need honey to survive over the 
    winter. If you take too much, the hive may not make it.
    <br><br>
    However, responsible harvesting doesnât harm bees. 
    Beekeepers work hard to protect their hives and do their best not to 
    remove too much honey. If youâre thinking of keeping bees, spend plenty of 
    time learning about how to care for a hive. Itâs best to get advice from an 
    expert before you start. 
    <br><br>
    After all, bees play an important part in our ecosystem.
     Itâs important for people to do what they can to help them. 
     Thatâs especially true for beekeepers who take responsibility for 
     their care. Do you dream of harvesting fresh honey from your own backyard 
     one day? Many think itâs a fun and very rewarding hobby!
    <br><br>
    The above was taken from <b>Wonderopolis Wonder of the day#2610 How do you harvest honey?</b>
    If you wish to do further reading on there website click the button below:

    <a href="https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/How-Do-You-Harvest-Honey#:~:text=To%20harvest%20honey%2C%20beekeepers%20pull,honeycomb%20without%20destroying%20the%20frame." target="_blank"><button class="my-link-button">Wonderopolis</button></a>
    <br><br>
    In the case where honey bees are ethically farmed, very little harm is done to the bees during the collection process. However it is important
    to make people awear that there are still aspects of the practice of keeping bees that do cause harm to the bees. However this does fall a little
    bit out of the scope of if honey is vegan or not so i will link to a webpage that talks about the ethics of bees. depending on your moral values 
    you may or may not agree with the website but i still believe it is good to be awear of other peoples perspectives so you can better grow your own morals.

  <h3>
    What is honey?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Nectar is the main ingredient for honey and also the main source of energy for bees. Using a 
    long straw-like tongue called a proboscis, honey bees suck up nectar droplets from the flowerâs special 
    nectar-making organ, called the nectary.
    <br><br>
    When the nectar reaches the beeâs honey stomach, the stomach 
    begins to break down the complex sugars of the nectar into more simple 
    sugars that are less prone to crystallization, or becoming solid. This process 
    is called âinversionâ.
    <br><br>
    Once a worker honey bee returns to the colony, it passes the nectar
     onto another younger bee called a house bee (between 12-17 days old).
     <br><br>
     House bees take the nectar inside the colony and pack it away in hexagon-shaped
      beeswax honey cells. They then turn the 
     nectar into honey by drying it out using a warm breeze made with their wings.
     <br><br>
     Once the honey has dried out, they put a lid over the honey cell using 
     fresh beeswax â kind of like a little honey jar. In the winter, when the flowers 
     have finished blooming and thereâs not as much nectar available, the bees can open 
     this lid and share the honey they saved.
  </p>
  <h3>
    So is honey vegan or not?
  </h3>
  <p>
    That will depend on why, you, the individual decided to be vegan. In my opinion if you are vegan
    for enviromental reasons i feel as though it is your best intrest to avoid consuming honey. However if your 
    a vegan for the reasons related to reducing animal suffering then it can be justified that so long 
    as you get your honey from a responsible bee keeper then there is no issue with consuming honey. Like i said
    before it all comes down to your own choices and moral opinions. Just do whatever feels right to you.
